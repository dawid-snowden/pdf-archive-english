# Dawid Snowden – Texts of Resistance

I am Dawid Snowden — not an influencer, not a mascot of moderation, not a compliant mouthpiece.  
I am an artist of resistance.

My work is not a decorative contribution to discourse, but a targeted assault on a system that sells control as progress.  
In my **texts, podcasts, songs, and videos**, I dismantle narratives, deconstruct ideologies, and confront the public with the reality buried beneath the headlines — raw, uncomfortable, unfiltered.

I don’t fight for clicks. I fight for awareness —  
**radical, relentless, direct.**

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository is an archive of upheaval.  
Here you’ll find all my published texts — uncensored, unpolished, untamed.

- Political indictments  
- Rhetorically sharp analysis  
- Essays on social and ideological critique  
- Satirical songs and rebellious lyrics  
- Scripts for podcasts and performances

Every text is a wrench in the machine. Every paragraph a signal against silence.  
**No ads. No bullshit. Just truth in its hardest form.**

## Why I Do This

Because we live in an age where submission is considered virtue.  
Because algorithms now manage our freedom.  
Because language has become a weapon — and I strike back.

My goal is not harmony, but disruption.  
I want people to wake up, raise their voices, recognize their chains — and shatter them.

Because the new slavery wears no iron shackles —  
**but data, terms & conditions, and morally wrapped obedience.**

## What You Can Do

If this moves you, provokes you, or shakes you — **share it.**  
Not as a trend. Not for likes.  
But as a conscious act of resistance.

Become a **disturbance in the system.**
